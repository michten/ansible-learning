#Task 10: Create and Work with Roles (Some More)

#Create a role called sample-apache and store it in /home/automation/plays/roles. The role should satisfy the following requirements:
#
#    The httpd, mod_ssl and php packages are installed. Apache service is running and enabled on boot.
#    Firewall is configured to allow all incoming traffic on HTTP port TCP 80 and HTTPS port TCP 443.
#    Apache service should be restarted every time the file /var/www/html/index.html is modified.
#    A Jinja2 template file index.html.j2 is used to create the file /var/www/html/index.html with the following content:

#The address of the server is: IPV4ADDRESS

#IPV4ADDRESS is the IP address of the managed node.

#Create a playbook /home/automation/plays/apache.yml that uses the role and runs on hosts in the webservers host group.
